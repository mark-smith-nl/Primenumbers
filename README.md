# Primenumbers
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
The fist prime number is two. All other primenumbers are odd numbers.

The used algorithm is based on the principle that a number is a prime number if no prime divisors can be found that are equal or the same as its root.
